# Visualising-Data
## Assignment 1
Tasks:

1. Find a dataset on a topic that you can understand.  Your final dataset should have at least eight attributes containing both qualitative and quantitative data. The dataset must have at least 200 rows.    Merging will enhance your marks. If you are doing this, you must explain the merge. These attributes should include the following types of data: 

  - Continuous Numeric data 
  - Categorical data  
  - Temporal data 
  - Location data 
  - Text data (attribute with text data, longer than 15 characters).

2. Explore the data by wrangling, and generating graphs in R, using Jupyter Notebook. Note distributions across the data and correlations between attributes. Fix errors and decide on how errors and omissions will be handled. Justify the chart types you have used in terms of the types of data in your dataset.  Use markdown cells to explain what you are doing.   Put your name and student number in the top of the notebook.  Develop a meta-data description of your dataset.

3. Form your Big Idea following your exploration.  You should now understand what the data is telling you, so you should be able to establish a message, an audience and what you want from the story. Describe your audience, who you will approach to pass on the message, and what is at stake for them. A sentence expressing your big idea.

4. Develop your Storyboard in a Jupyter Notebook using R, ensuring that you are telling the truth insofar as the data tells you.  If you suspect that there are factors that are not depicted in your dataset, please disclose this.  The graphs that you produce should be essential to the story.
